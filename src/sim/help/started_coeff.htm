<em><strong>Specify coefficients/weights</strong></em> <br>
<hr size="1">
<p>1 Open the behavior network definition window.There are four ways to do this.<br>
  1). Double click the "Entity Dynamics" node in the navigation tree. <br>
  2). Right click the entity node and in the popup menu, select "Setup Dynamics" 
  -> "Mutual Inhibition" <em>or</em> "Vector Sum". <br>
  3). Select the entity node and click the "Define Entity Dynamics" item in the 
  tool bar. <br>
  4). Select the entity node and click the "Define Entity Dynamics" item in the 
  menu bar. <br>
  <br>
  The following figure shows the approach 2), 3), 4). <br>

  <br>
  <strong>Tip</strong>: In the last two ways, the node representing the desired 
  entity should be selected first. <br>
  <br>
  2 In the window, a tree (named "agent behavior tree") is shown in the top left 
  side which displays all behaviors already existing in the behavior network of 
  this entity. Another tree (named "system behavior tree") is shown in the bottom 
  left side which displays all available behavior networks in the system. The 
  behavior network is shown in the top right side and the coefficients configurations 
  are shown in the bottom right side.<br>

    <br>
    3 After all behaviors for the agent are added, the last step is to configure the static/dynamic coefficients/weights of the agent's behavior network. <br>
    <br>
	<strong>a.</strong> For static coefficients, type in real numbers ( [-1.0 ~ +1.0] ) into the table. In this table, the column behavior inhibit (if (0.0, 1.0]) or excite (if [-1.0, 0.0)) or puts no effct on (if 0.0) the row behavior. For example,  the first column behavior "escape" will inhibit "escape", "retreat", "defend", "hide", "eat", "forage" and "swim" with coefficients 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.9, 0.9 and 0.9 respectively. <br> <strong>b.</strong> For dynamic coefficients, firstly select "Dynamical coefficients" , which will disable the table above it and will enable the text area below it. Then, type in Java codes in the text area.<br><strong>c.</strong> Click OK button to submit the setting.
