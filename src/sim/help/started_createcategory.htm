<em><strong>Creating a category</strong></em> <br>
<hr size="1">
Category management (create, update, delete category, etc.) is an important step in the development of an application. In BehaviorSim, every entity belongs to a category. A category defines common properties (methods and fields) of entities belong to the category. Creating a category includes two basic steps. <br>
1. Creating category basic information, including name, picture, action selection mechanism, and fields.<br>
2. Creating new methods. 
<br>
You can also create a new category based on an existing category through copy-and-paste.
