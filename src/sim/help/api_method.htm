<em><strong>Using method editor</strong></em> <br>
There are three GUIs using the method editor. One is defining methods in category 
definition window (Refer to &quot;Creating a new method&quot; for more details). 
Another is creating behaviors in behavior network window (Refer to &quot;Creating 
a new behavior&quot; for more details). The third one is creating general dynamics (Refer to &quot;Creating 
general dynamics&quot; for more details).<br><br>
The interface of method editor is shown below. <br>

You can type the character '@' to see all available system APIs, and self-defined 
methods <em>or</em> fields. The methods and fields are shown in a popup list as 
below. The methods and fields are categorized and sorted. Both keyboard and mouse 
can be used to select an item.<br>
