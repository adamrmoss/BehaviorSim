<em><strong>Application</strong></em> <br>
<hr size="1">
In BehaviorSim, each behavior-based control simulation is defined as an <em>Application</em>. Three important components<br> 
of an application are Application Directory, Resource Directory, and Application Name. Application Directory is the <br>
directory where an application is stored. Resource Directory is the directory where all resources of an application are <br>
stored. Application Name is the name of an application. <br><br>

One important file storing in the Application Directory is <em>Model File</em>, which will be introduced in another page. In current <br>
version (1.0), for simplicity, Resource Directory is a directory within the Application Directory. Resource Directory can be <br>
same as Application Directory, which means that all application data will be stored in Application Directory. Two general <br>
directory structures of an application are shown in the following figure.<br>

Resource Directory in the top application is same as Application Directory. While Resource Directory in the bottom application<br>
is &quot;resources&quot;, which is under Application Directory.
