<em><strong>Creating behavior by copying existing 
one</strong></em> <br>
<hr size="1">
<p>1 Open the behavior network definition window.There are four ways to do this.<br>
  1). Double click the "Entity Dynamics" node in the navigation tree. <br>
  2). Right click the entity node and in the popup menu, select "Setup Dynamics" 
  -> "Mutual Inhibition" <em>or</em> "Vector Sum". <br>
  3). Select the entity node and click the "Define Entity Dynamics" item in the 
  tool bar. <br>
  4). Select the entity node and click the "Define Entity Dynamics" item in the 
  menu bar. <br>
  <br>
  The following figure shows the approach 2), 3), 4). <br>

  <br>
  <strong>Tip</strong>: In the last two ways, the node representing the desired 
  entity should be selected first. <br>
  <br>
  2 In the window, a tree (named "agent behavior tree") is shown in the top left 
  side which displays all behaviors already existing in the behavior network of 
  this entity. Another tree (named "system behavior tree") is shown in the bottom 
  left side which displays all available behavior networks in the system. The 
  behavior network is shown in the top right side and the coefficients configurations 
  are shown in the bottom right side.<br>

  3 Click "Copy This Behavior" in the popup menu which is brought up by right clicking the target behavior of another entity.<br>

  <br>
  4 Click "Paste Behavior" in the popup menu shown in the figure of step 2. <br><br>
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> A behavior network can also be created in a similar way by copying 
  the target behavior network and then pasting it into the currect behavior network.
