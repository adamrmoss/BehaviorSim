<em><strong>Specifying behavior action through task queue</strong></em> <br>
<hr size="1">
<p>Behavior actions should be specified in one of the two ways. The first way 
  does not use a task queue. "move(2.0, 0.0); turn(0.1)", for example. In this 
  case, a single action is specified, "move(2.0, 0.0)" and "turn(0.1)" will be 
  executed in one time step. </p>
<p>The other way is using a task queue. "TASKQUEUE.add("move(2.0, 0.0)"); TASKQUEUE.add("turn(0.1)");" 
  for example. In this case, "move(2.0, 0.0)" and "turn(0.1)" will be executed 
  sequentially in two consecutive time steps.</p>
<p> In the task-queue approach, the java code only consists of a series of statement 
  TASKQUEUE.add(JAVA_METHOD_CALL). <br>
  JAVA_METHOD_CALL is the call of a java method which returns a String object 
  "SPEED, DIRECTION" used to guide the movement. SPEED is moving speed and DIRECTION 
  is moving direction. Either is a double number. </p>
<p>
  In the above example, move(2.0, 0.0) is a JAVA_METHOD_CALL which return the 
  string "2.0, 0.0" indicating the entity will move foward horizontally one step 
  with the speed 2.0. </p>
<p>
  <em><strong>NOTE that</strong></em>, variables can be used in a JAVA_METHOD_CALL. For example, <br>
  double movingSpeed = 2.0;<br>
  TASKQUEUE.add("move("+movingSpeed+", 0.0)");</p>
