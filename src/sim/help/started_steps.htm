<em><strong>Major steps in application development</strong></em> <br>
<hr size="1">
Some major steps involved in developing a behavior-based application are listed as follows. 
 <br>
<ul>
  <ui>1) Create a new application, or open an existing application. In this step, 
  parameters of the application and corresponding simulation world can be adjusted 
  through the popup menu of the navigation tree. <br>
  <br>
  For example, change the application name; change the background of the simulation 
  world; or change the size of the simulation world, etc. The popup menu can be 
  shown up by right-clicking of the tree node.</ui> <br>
  <br>
  <ui>2) Create categories. The category defining panel can be shown up through 
  "Define Category" menu item or tool bar. Both category fields and methods can 
  be defined there. Copy-and-paste is supported as a convenient way to define 
  a new category based an existing one. Refer to the page "Instructions on defining 
  a Category" for more details.</ui><br>
  <br>
  3) Create entities. By simply dragging the category icon into the simulation 
  world, an entity can be created. The initial state of the entity is inherited 
  from the corresponding category object. Properties of the entity can be updated 
  through the popup menu of navigation tree. <br>
  <br>
  <ui>4) Create general dynamics or behavior network. The panel can be shown up 
  through "Define Entity Dynamics" menu item or tool bar. Refer to the page "Instructions 
  on defining general dynamics" or "Instructions 
  on defining Behavior network" for more details.</ui> <br>
  <br>
  <ui>5) Start simulation. The simulation data will be calculated automatically. 
  Once the simulation data is available, the simulation can be started.</ui> 
</ul>
