<font size="4" ><strong>1. Always build application incremently.</strong></font> </p> <br>
BehaivorSim is still in development, which means that the software may contain 
some unkown bugs which may force you restart the environment in some situations. 
Thus, it is better to develop the application incremently and save it frequently 
so that you do not need to redo some work in the case of restart. <br>
<br>
A good way to automatically save the work is using the "Automatic Save" tool in the tool bar. Once you specify time interval and click &quot;Schedule&quot; button, 
BehaviorSim will periodically save your work .
